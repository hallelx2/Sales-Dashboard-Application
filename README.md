## Sample Streamlit Dashboard - README

**Functionality:**

* This dashboard allows users to upload or use a sample dataset for sales analysis.
* Users can filter the data by date range, region, state, and city using interactive widgets.
* The dashboard provides various visualizations to explore the data, including:
    * Category-wise Sales Bar Chart
    * Region-wise Sales Pie Chart
    * Time Series Line Chart for Sales over Months
    * Sales TreeMap (Hierarchical view)
    * Segment-wise and Category-wise Sales Pie Charts
    * Month-wise Sub-Category Sales Summary Table
    * Month-wise Sub-Category Sales Pivot Table
    * Scatter Plot (Sales vs Profit)
* Users can download the data for each chart and a sample of the original dataset as CSV files.

**Code Structure:**

* The code is well-structured and organized with clear comments explaining each section.
* It utilizes Streamlit functions for layout, data manipulation, and user interaction.
* Data visualization is primarily achieved using Plotly Express (`px`).

**Running the Dashboard:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dashboard.py`).
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`streamlit`, `pandas`, `plotly`, etc.). You can install them using `pip install <library_name>`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the script using `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
5. This will launch the Streamlit app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

**Further Enhancements:**

* The code provides a solid foundation for a data exploration dashboard. 
* You can extend it by:
    * Adding more charts and visualizations based on your specific data analysis needs.
    * Implementing additional filters and interactivity features.
    * Connecting to a database or live data source.
